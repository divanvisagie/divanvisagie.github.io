<p>The internet is full of tutorials on how to start developing in C++ ,but in my opinion, a lot of them start funny and are quite old. Another thing to think about is that one reference is never enough.
A good idea is to actually look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">wiki page for C++</a> before you even begin to see what you are getting yourself into.
Once you have read the wiki page and understood at least some syntax. The next thing you want to do is choose an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>. Don't choose something old , choose something simple and logical that works well in your operating system of choice.
For Windows and Linux my choice of IDE is the same ,<a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt Creator</a> ,one may ask why not <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express">Visual Studio </a> for Windows? Well because Visual Studio's generated code for C++ classes isn't really a standard so it doesn't really fit  with a lot of the standard C++ tutorials out there and that may confuse you.
However there is nothing wrong with Visual Studio, and if Qt creator is messing around with you and you just want to get done with &quot;hello world&quot; then maybe Visual studio is a better bet for you.Finally my choice of IDE for OSX is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> .Although Qt Creator runs on OSX as well, Xcode is bliss and is designed with Languages like C/C++ and Objective-C in mind and the assistant editor is very helpful to view header and source counterparts at the same time.

<a href="http://i.microsoft.com/visualstudio/_base_v1/images/chrome/visual_studio_logo.png"><img src="image1.png" alt="screenshot"></a>
That said there are lots of IDEs out there , so you can choose any one that suits you.
Once you have familiarised yourself with how to create a new C++ project  in your IDE of choice,you need to get yourself some simple tutorials ,and yes ,you do have to start out with console based apps, thats just the way it works and its a good way to get familiar with logic.A good place to start is to go to <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">http://www.cplusplus.com</a> , download their <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/files/tutorial.pdf">PDF tutorial</a> and work through it. If you are more inclined to material books or need more ,a good beginners book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-C-Practical-Programming-Example/dp/020170353X">Accelerated C++</a> .
<a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/images/smallcover.jpg"><img src="image2.jpg" alt="screenshot"></a>
Now comes the main piece of advice,once you are happy with your skills in the console , make a simple 2d game. First start looking into OpenGL at <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">Neon Helium Productions</a> and work through some of the 2d tutorials ,even basic cubes in 3D or beyond depending on your confidence. But use these skills to build a 2d game, something like a space invaders clone or a 2d shooter , and when you get stuck , Google the problem until you find an answer.
The game doesn't have to look amazing, it just has to work amazing. The point of the exercise is to give you a working point for becoming better at the language ,by adding functionality to your game such as saving levels ,logging high scores ,adding a map editor or improving gameplay by optimising the performance of your code.
In my opinion a game is never finished ,there is always something you will want to add , something you will want to improve,and that is why it is perfect for learning more about a language,it provides a reason for you to look up tutorials on things that you may not have thought of otherwise. And when you have fully exhausted all posible features in 2d , go 3d because thats a whole new dimension.</p>
