<h1 class="title">Innovation</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">You're Doing It Wrong</h2>
<span class="date">2012-12-22</span>

I don't think a lot of people understand what this word means, and I find it being used incorrectly quite a lot. Apple uses it incorrectly a lot by calling improvement innovation, and to add to the irony critics say "Patents hold back innovation".

How exactly does an exclusive right over an original invention hold back the creation of something new?

Simple answer, it doesn't, what it does however is limit people's ability to improve upon what already exists and commercialise it. Note the word improve, this is probably what a lot of these critics are talking about. But even in the case of improvement, the people who have existing patents might actually pay you to use your improvement ideas.

Patents can work with improvement and if what you are doing is really innovation, there won't be an existing patent anyway.

Please understand what a word means before you create a buzz-phrase around it.
