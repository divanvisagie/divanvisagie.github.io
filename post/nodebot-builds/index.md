I've started a project that I hope really gets off the ground. It's just a simple GitHub page that lists successful nodebot projects.

The idea is to keep a list of successful projects that detail the hardware and open source the software involved in making the nodebot. This will give people an indication of the complexity and cost of a project before diving in and hopefully sidestep any issues the original creator may have encountered.

I hope this will serve as a platform for beginners to launch off of, nodebot veterans to pass on knowledge and as a gauge to the size of the nodebot community.

As a start and to show what I had in mind, I've added my own project as an example to the list. However any input on formatting would be graciously accepted, after all, this is open source!
