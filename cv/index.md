# Skills

Probably my most used programming language to date, I've worked with it for over 6 years. I've used it on the front-end with multiple frameworks over the years including jQuery, Knockout, AngularJS, Angular, React... etc. I have also made Use of Node.JS at multiple points for both backends and custom tooling.

### C# / .Net

I have made use of .Net throughout my career from monolithic applications to microservices as well as Mobile applications in Xamarin. Most of my knowledge about SOLID principles and software design patterns were learned in this language.
