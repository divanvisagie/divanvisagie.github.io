# About me

I'm a senior software engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden, with experience across mobile, web, and backend systems. Lately I've focused on privacy, consent, and regulatory compliance (GDPR and US state laws), building high-scale systems that give users clear choice and control.

On this site I share practical notes from over a decade in engineering—covering architecture, developer experience, and occasional deep dives into the things I've shipped.

- **Current interests:** consent & preferences platforms, event-driven systems, performance and cost tuning, and writing to think.
- **Past lives:** native iOS, cross-platform mobile, frontend frameworks from AngularJS to React, and .NET/Node services.
