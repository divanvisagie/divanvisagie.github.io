I created [http://dvisagie.blogspot.com/](http://dvisagie.blogspot.com/) as a pretty much an all purpose blog for all of my everythings. This is an attempt at starting a neatly ordered blog about code that is easier to navigate and makes a lot more sense , my main languages of focus will be Objective-C/C++ ,C/C++ ,web(PHP,CSS,HTML,JavaScript). I will hopefully be starting off with a beginners guide to iOS development in Objective-C soon,so stay tuned.
