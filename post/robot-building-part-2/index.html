<h2>Tanked</h2>
<p>In my <a href="/post/robot-building-part-1">previous post</a> I concluded that legs were not suitable for what I wanted to do and that tank treads, while way overboard, would solve my weight bearing problems. So I ordered a Rover 5.</p>
<h2>Unforeseen Requirements</h2>
<p>When I received the rover base I realised that I didn't have a motor controller, and since I didn't fully understand how an H-Bridge worked I decided to build a motor controller from 6 relays and 4 transistors. After prototyping on a breadboard I moved it to a proto-board.</p>
<p>The soldering was a whole new experience. I am sure that I spent about 6 hours on this thing and it looks nothing like the work of someone who is experienced. You couldn't fire tracer rounds in this department, because in hardware land, test-fix cycles take a whole lot longer.</p>
<p><img src="controller.jpg" alt="Motor controller prototype"></p>
<p>When I was finally done, I wrote a quick Node script and could happily listen to the clicky sound of the relays as the rover moved forward.</p>
<h2>Blue Smoke</h2>
<p>The next day I was all excited to hook up the Raspberry Pi and didn't check the polarity of my battery connector before I connected it. When I saw the blue smoke I had read about on the internet, I knew my transistors were fried.</p>
<p>The problem then with having soldered really close together is that I couldn't just replace the transistors, the joints were all over the place.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>There are 3 things that I have learned from this experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Polarity matters</li>
<li>Hardware is a whole different ballgame</li>
<li>Sometimes it's just easier to buy things</li>
</ol>
<p>I have since just bought a motor controller, because the time it would take to repair my home built motor controller would be better spent on other aspects of the project: building a robot.</p>
