# About me
## What is this website?

The goal of this website is for me to share the knowledge I have obtained in my 9 year Software Engineering career. 

I cover topics from simple to advanced in a way that is more descriptive than prescriptive. I am not here to sell you on any particular technology but to provide solutions to common problems. Since some of those problems are focused on career and not programming, I will sometimes write about soft skills as well.
